## Project Title
StudyGroupIncentives

## Project Description
StudyGroupIncentives is a decentralized incentivization system built on Ethereum. It uses an ERC20 token to reward participants who attend and engage in educational sessions. Moderators can create sessions, and students can mark attendance during sessions. Upon completion, students can claim a reward in the form of tokens for their participation. The contract is built with security and non-reentrancy mechanisms to ensure fair reward distribution.

## Project Vision
The vision of StudyGroupIncentives is to create a blockchain-powered reward system that encourages active participation in study groups, educational seminars, and learning sessions. By leveraging smart contracts, we aim to provide a transparent and automated way to incentivize learners, helping them stay engaged and motivated throughout their educational journey.

## Key Features

- **ERC20 Token Rewards:** Rewards are distributed in the form of ERC20 tokens for attending and completing sessions.
  
- **Session Creation:** Moderators (or owners) can create sessions with a specific topic, timestamp, duration, and reward amount.
  
- **Attendance Marking:** Students can mark their attendance during the active time window of a session, ensuring fair participation.

- **Reward Claiming:** After a session ends, students who attended can claim their rewards automatically via the smart contract.

- **Security Features:** The contract uses the `ReentrancyGuard` and `nonReentrant` modifier to prevent reentrancy attacks, ensuring secure reward claims.

- **Moderators & Owners:** Only moderators or owners can create new sessions and manage the system, ensuring control over the platform's operations.

- **Transparency & Automation:** The entire process from session creation to reward claiming is automated and transparent, eliminating the need for third-party involvement.

- **Minimum Attendance Requirement:** A minimum attendance time is set to ensure sessions are meaningful and rewarding for participants.
